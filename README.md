📊 Suicide Data Analysis using Power BI

Understanding Global Suicide Trends Across Gender and Generations (2009–2012)

 

📁 Project Overview

This project explores global suicide trends using a Power BI dashboard built on publicly available data. The aim is to analyze the demographic patterns of suicide across gender, age, and generation groups to generate insights that could support mental health policy decisions, public awareness, and resource allocation.

🔍 Key Focus: Which demographic groups are most affected by suicide, and what patterns can be observed from the data between 2009 and 2012?

🧠 Objectives

Analyze suicide data across 101 countries

Identify high-risk age groups, genders, and generations

Use Power BI Key Influencers visual to uncover impactful variables

Create interactive visualizations for data storytelling

Provide actionable insights that can guide suicide prevention strategies
